Hello Sir,
I have found your blog http://housingsocietymaharashtra.blogspot.in/ very useful multiple times.
And have got your email from the blog.
I have a query regarding deemed conveyance and stamp duty payment of flat, and will be much obliged to get any clarification.

I had purchased a flat in Chakala, Andheri East area, with agrrement dated 10-November-1980.
The agreement was stamped with Rs 5 stamp at that time. The flat area is 430 sq ft built up.

Now with the deemed conveyance in progress, the market value of the property is determined at the rate of Rs 780 per sq. ft..
This means the market value is at 3,35,400. This is more than 8 times the agreement value.

My question is,
How does the market value gets calculated for agreement made in 1980? Is there any method that is adopted in this case?
My belief is that the ready recknors became available post 1990.
So in this case can you provide some knowledge on how would market value in Andheri East be calculated in 1980?

Any information in this regard will be very useful to me.

Thank you.
VK Joshi



Hello Sir,
Thank you for the details on this site.
My query is regarding point no. 10. "DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE"
My property is purchased in December 1980 and is situated in Chakala, Andheri East.
As per the table for this period the market value is "50% of Market value of 1990".

Where can I find the "Market value of 1990" for the Chakala, Andheri East location.
Since the deemed conveyance process is going on I am finding out this information.

Thank you
